# your
This repository contains a **modified version of the [`your`](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/your)** package, adapted for use in my MSc project:

> **Enhancing Narrowband FRB Search Sensitivity Using Machine Learning**

## Modification

To identify Narrowband pulses correctly , we have implimented a dynamic DM range in the DM-time plot to see the bow-tie structure clearly.

## Installation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/your.git
cd your
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
``` 
## Usages

Same as original [your](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/your).
the documentaton can be found at [docs](https://thepetabyteproject.github.io/your/).
